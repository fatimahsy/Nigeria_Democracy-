2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The dataset was created by Afrobarometer, a pan-African research organization, in partnership with local country teams in Nigeria.

3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - Afrobarometer is funded by multiple international organizations, including the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), USAID, and the Mo Ibrahim Foundation.
