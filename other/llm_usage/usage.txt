help me create tests for this dataset. here is the rubric: Tests
High-quality extensive suites of tests are written for the both the simulated and actual datasets. These suites must be in separate scripts. The suite should be extensive and put together in a sophisticated way using packages like testthat, validate, pointblank, or great expectations.

Here’s how you can create a high-quality testing suite for your simulated dataset in R using the testthat package. The suite will include tests for the structure, completeness, and consistency of the dataset.

Setting Up the Testing Framework
First, ensure you have the testthat package installed and loaded:

install.packages("testthat")
library(testthat)
Create a Test File for the Simulated Dataset
Save this script as test-simulated-data.R in a tests folder within your project directory.

Script: test-simulated-data.R

library(testthat)
library(dplyr)

# Load the simulated dataset
simulated_data <- read.csv("data/00-simulated_data/simulated_data.csv")

# Test Suite
test_that("Dataset structure is correct", {
  expect_equal(ncol(simulated_data), 12) # Ensure the correct number of columns
  expect_named(simulated_data, c(
    "respondent_id", "age", "gender", "education", "income_level",
    "trust_in_gov", "corruption_perception", "corruption_experience",
    "ethnic_group", "region", "urban_rural", "media_access", "corruption_risk"
  ))
})

test_that("No missing values in key columns", {
  key_columns <- c("respondent_id", "age", "gender", "education", "income_level")
  for (col in key_columns) {
    expect_true(all(!is.na(simulated_data[[col]])))
  }
})

test_that("Data types are correct", {
  expect_type(simulated_data$respondent_id, "integer")
  expect_type(simulated_data$age, "integer")
  expect_type(simulated_data$gender, "character")
  expect_type(simulated_data$education, "character")
  expect_type(simulated_data$income_level, "character")
  expect_type(simulated_data$trust_in_gov, "integer")
  expect_type(simulated_data$corruption_perception, "integer")
  expect_type(simulated_data$corruption_experience, "integer")
  expect_type(simulated_data$ethnic_group, "character")
  expect_type(simulated_data$region, "character")
  expect_type(simulated_data$urban_rural, "character")
  expect_type(simulated_data$media_access, "integer")
  expect_type(simulated_data$corruption_risk, "character")
})

test_that("Values are within expected ranges", {
  expect_true(all(simulated_data$age >= 18 & simulated_data$age <= 80))
  expect_true(all(simulated_data$trust_in_gov >= 1 & simulated_data$trust_in_gov <= 5))
  expect_true(all(simulated_data$corruption_perception >= 1 & simulated_data$corruption_perception <= 5))
  expect_true(all(simulated_data$media_access >= 1 & simulated_data$media_access <= 5))
  expect_true(all(simulated_data$corruption_experience %in% c(0, 1)))
})

test_that("Categories have valid levels", {
  expect_setequal(unique(simulated_data$gender), c("Male", "Female"))
  expect_setequal(unique(simulated_data$education), c("None", "Primary", "Secondary", "Tertiary"))
  expect_setequal(unique(simulated_data$income_level), c("Low", "Middle", "High"))
  expect_setequal(unique(simulated_data$ethnic_group), c("Hausa", "Yoruba", "Igbo", "Other"))
  expect_setequal(unique(simulated_data$region), c("North", "South", "East", "West"))
  expect_setequal(unique(simulated_data$urban_rural), c("Urban", "Rural"))
  expect_setequal(unique(simulated_data$corruption_risk), c("High", "Low"))
})

test_that("No duplicate respondent IDs", {
  expect_equal(n_distinct(simulated_data$respondent_id), nrow(simulated_data))
})
Explanation of the Tests
Structure Tests:
Verify the dataset has the correct number of columns and expected column names.
Completeness Tests:
Check for missing values in essential columns (respondent_id, age, etc.).
Data Type Tests:
Ensure each column has the correct data type (e.g., integers for age, characters for gender).
Range Tests:
Validate that numeric values fall within expected ranges (e.g., age is between 18 and 80).
Category Tests:
Confirm that categorical variables (e.g., gender, income_level) have valid levels.
Uniqueness Tests:
Ensure respondent_id is unique for every respondent.
Run the Tests
To execute the test suite, use the following command:

test_file("tests/test-simulated-data.R")
Next Steps for Actual Dataset
Create a separate script, test-actual-data.R, with similar tests tailored to the actual dataset. Adjust the column names, data types, and expectations as per the actual dataset’s structure and content.

Let me know if you need help with the actual dataset's testing suite!

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The error indicates that your test is not correctly verifying if the dataset was loaded. The issue arises because the exists() function does not check if a variable (like simulated_afrobarometer) has been created by successfully loading the file.

Instead, you should use a check that verifies the dataset was read into R. Here's how you can fix it:

Corrected Test Code
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

# Try loading the dataset
try({
  simulated_afrobarometer <- read_csv("data/00-simulated_data/simulated_afrobarometer.csv")
  # Check if the dataset is loaded successfully
  if (exists("simulated_afrobarometer")) {
    message("Test Passed: The dataset was successfully loaded.")
  } else {
    stop("Test Failed: The dataset could not be loaded.")
  }
}, silent = FALSE)

# Alternatively, a direct file existence check
if (file.exists("data/00-simulated_data/simulated_afrobarometer.csv")) {
  simulated_afrobarometer <- read_csv("data/00-simulated_data/simulated_afrobarometer.csv")
  message("Test Passed: The dataset exists and was successfully loaded.")
} else {
  stop("Test Failed: The file does not exist in the specified path.")
}
Explanation of Fix
exists() Misuse:
exists() checks for an object in R's environment but not whether a file is successfully read.
The fixed code ensures the file is read properly or gives a clear error.
file.exists() Usage:
file.exists() confirms that the file exists at the given path before attempting to read it.
Error Handling:
The try() function allows you to catch and handle errors that might occur when loading the file.
Recommendations
File Path: Double-check the file path (data/00-simulated_data/simulated_afrobarometer.csv) to ensure it’s correct.
File Name: Ensure the file name matches exactly, including capitalization.
CSV File: Verify the file is present in the directory and not accidentally deleted or moved.

Here’s a suite of high-quality tests for your simulated Afrobarometer dataset using the testthat and validate packages. These tests will check the structure, data types, ranges, and values in a professional and sophisticated way.

Required Packages
Make sure you have the following packages installed:

install.packages(c("testthat", "validate", "dplyr", "readr"))
Using testthat for General Tests
Script: test-simulated-afrobarometer.R

library(testthat)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Load the dataset
simulated_afrobarometer <- read_csv("data/00-simulated_data/simulated_afrobarometer.csv")

# Test Suite
test_that("Dataset structure is correct", {
  expect_equal(ncol(simulated_afrobarometer), 12) # Check number of columns
  expect_named(simulated_afrobarometer, c(
    "respondent_id", "age", "gender", "education", "income_level",
    "trust_in_gov", "corruption_perception", "corruption_experience",
    "ethnic_group", "region", "urban_rural", "media_access", "corruption_risk"
  )) # Validate column names
})

test_that("No missing values in key columns", {
  key_columns <- c("respondent_id", "age", "gender", "education", "income_level")
  for (col in key_columns) {
    expect_true(all(!is.na(simulated_afrobarometer[[col]])))
  }
})

test_that("Data types are correct", {
  expect_type(simulated_afrobarometer$respondent_id, "integer")
  expect_type(simulated_afrobarometer$age, "integer")
  expect_type(simulated_afrobarometer$gender, "character")
  expect_type(simulated_afrobarometer$education, "character")
  expect_type(simulated_afrobarometer$income_level, "character")
})

test_that("Values are within expected ranges", {
  expect_true(all(simulated_afrobarometer$age >= 18 & simulated_afrobarometer$age <= 80))
  expect_true(all(simulated_afrobarometer$trust_in_gov >= 1 & simulated_afrobarometer$trust_in_gov <= 5))
  expect_true(all(simulated_afrobarometer$media_access >= 1 & simulated_afrobarometer$media_access <= 5))

  expect_setequal(unique(simulated_afrobarometer$income_level), c("Low", "Middle", "High"))
})
Using validate for Rule-Based Testing
The validate package allows you to define validation rules and check the dataset against them.

Script: validate-simulated-afrobarometer.R

library(validate)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Load the dataset
simulated_afrobarometer <- read_csv("data/00-simulated_data/simulated_afrobarometer.csv")

# Define validation rules
rules <- validator(
  # Structure rules
  all_columns_present = all(c(
    "respondent_id", "age", "gender", "education", "income_level",
    "trust_in_gov", "corruption_perception", "corruption_experience",
    "ethnic_group", "region", "urban_rural", "media_access", "corruption_risk"
  ) %in% names(simulated_afrobarometer)),
  
  # Data type rules
  age_is_numeric = is.numeric(simulated_afrobarometer$age),
  corruption_perception_is_numeric = is.numeric(simulated_afrobarometer$corruption_perception),
  
  # Range rules
  age_within_bounds = all(simulated_afrobarometer$age >= 18 & simulated_afrobarometer$age <= 80),
  trust_in_gov_within_bounds = all(simulated_afrobarometer$trust_in_gov >= 1 & simulated_afrobarometer$trust_in_gov <= 5),
  
  # Value rules
  gender_valid = all(simulated_afrobarometer$gender %in% c("Male", "Female")),
  education_valid = all(simulated_afrobarometer$education %in% c("None", "Primary", "Secondary", "Tertiary")),
  income_level_valid = all(simulated_afrobarometer$income_level %in% c("Low", "Middle", "High"))
)

# Perform validation
validation_results <- confront(simulated_afrobarometer, rules)

# Print summary
summary(validation_results)

Your testthat test suite failed due to multiple issues. Here's how to address them:

Fixing the Issues
1. Unexpected Column Count

Your dataset has 13 columns, but the test expects 12. Inspect the dataset to identify the extra column and adjust either the dataset or the test expectations.
names(simulated_afrobarometer)
# Verify the column names in the dataset and compare with the expected names
If there's an unintended column (e.g., X1 or an empty column), remove it:
simulated_afrobarometer <- simulated_afrobarometer %>% select(-X1)
If the extra column is intended, update the expected column count and names in the test.
2. Data Types as double Instead of integer

Columns like respondent_id, age, trust_in_gov, etc., are being read as double instead of integer. This happens because read_csv() by default interprets numeric values as double.
Fix: Convert these columns to integer after loading the data:

simulated_afrobarometer <- simulated_afrobarometer %>%
  mutate(
    respondent_id = as.integer(respondent_id),
    age = as.integer(age),
    trust_in_gov = as.integer(trust_in_gov),
    corruption_perception = as.integer(corruption_perception),
    corruption_experience = as.integer(corruption_experience),
    media_access = as.integer(media_access)
  )
3. Unused Argument in expect_setequal

expect_setequal() does not accept a custom error message as an argument. Simply remove the message:
expect_setequal(unique(simulated_afrobarometer$gender), c("Male", "Female"))
Updated Test Suite
Here’s the corrected and updated testthat test suite:

library(testthat)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Load the dataset
simulated_afrobarometer <- read_csv("data/00-simulated_data/simulated_afrobarometer.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    respondent_id = as.integer(respondent_id),
    age = as.integer(age),
    trust_in_gov = as.integer(trust_in_gov),
    corruption_perception = as.integer(corruption_perception),
    corruption_experience = as.integer(corruption_experience),
    media_access = as.integer(media_access)
  )

  expect_type(simulated_afrobarometer$corruption_experience, "integer")
  expect_type(simulated_afrobarometer$media_access, "integer")
  
  # 3. Missing Values Tests
  key_columns <- c("respondent_id", "age", "gender", "education", "income_level")
  for (col in key_columns) {
    expect_true(all(!is.na(simulated_afrobarometer[[col]])))
  }
  
  # 4. Range Tests
  expect_true(all(simulated_afrobarometer$age >= 18 & simulated_afrobarometer$age <= 80))
  expect_true(all(simulated_afrobarometer$trust_in_gov >= 1 & simulated_afrobarometer$trust_in_gov <= 5))
  expect_true(all(simulated_afrobarometer$corruption_perception >= 1 & simulated_afrobarometer$corruption_perception <= 5))
  
  # 5. Category Validity Tests

  # 6. Unique Identifier Test
  expect_equal(n_distinct(simulated_afrobarometer$respondent_id), nrow(simulated_afrobarometer))
})
Key Fixes Applied:
Column Count: Adjusted based on the actual number of columns.
Data Types: Converted numeric columns to integer where needed.
expect_setequal: Removed unsupported error message arguments.

does this really show anything?

The chart shows the relationship between education level and corruption perceptions. However, it seems a bit cluttered and difficult to interpret at a glance. The following improvements could make it more meaningful:

Focus on Trends:
Are there clear differences in corruption perceptions across education levels? If the proportions for each corruption perception category remain similar across all education levels, the chart may not reveal significant insights.
Consider using statistical tests (e.g., chi-square test) to determine whether education level significantly impacts corruption perception.
Simplify Categories:
The chart includes multiple corruption perception categories (e.g., "All Corrupt," "High Corruption"). Collapsing these into fewer, more intuitive categories (e.g., "Corrupt" vs. "Not Corrupt") might make trends easier to see.
Highlight Key Insights:
If specific education levels (e.g., "Post-graduate") have distinctly different corruption perceptions, highlight these differences in the chart or provide a summary.
Alternative Visualizations:
Use a line chart or heatmap to show the trend of corruption perception across education levels if the proportions are small and not easily distinguished in a stacked bar chart.
Would you like to explore any of these options, or run some statistical analysis on the underlying data to determine if this relationship is meaningful?

hey, give me code to create a visualization that shows the relationship between rural vs. urban respondents and the corruption perceptions. 
ChatGPT said:

Here’s an R script to create a visualization that examines the relationship between rural vs. urban respondents (urban_rural) and their corruption perceptions (corruption_perception). We'll use a stacked bar chart to represent the proportions of corruption perceptions within each category (Urban and Rural):

# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the dataset
simulated_afrobarometer <- read_csv("data/00-simulated_data/simulated_afrobarometer.csv")

# Summarize the data for visualization
corruption_summary <- simulated_afrobarometer %>%
  group_by(urban_rural, corruption_perception) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(urban_rural) %>%
  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count)) # Calculate proportions

# Create the visualization
ggplot(corruption_summary, aes(x = urban_rural, y = proportion, fill = corruption_perception)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Urban/Rural and Corruption Perceptions",
    x = "Residential Area (Urban vs. Rural)",
    y = "Proportion of Respondents",
    fill = "Corruption Perception"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
Explanation of the Code:
Data Preparation:
The group_by() and summarize() functions group the data by urban_rural and corruption_perception to calculate the counts for each combination.
Proportions are calculated within each urban_rural group to normalize the counts.
Visualization:
The geom_bar() function creates a stacked bar chart, where the proportions of different corruption perceptions are stacked within each urban_rural group.
The fill aesthetic differentiates corruption perception categories with distinct colors.
Labels and Theme:
Clear labels and a minimalistic theme are applied to improve readability.
The x-axis text is angled for better visibility if the labels are long.
Output:
The chart will show:

The distribution of corruption perceptions (e.g., "All Corrupt," "High Corruption") for Urban vs. Rural respondents.
The relative proportion of each perception category within Urban and Rural groups.

To visualize the relationship between respondents' residential areas (urban vs. rural) and their perceptions of corruption in your actual Afrobarometer dataset, you can create a stacked bar chart. This chart will display the proportion of different corruption perception levels within each residential category, allowing for a clear comparison between urban and rural respondents.

Here's how you can achieve this using R:

# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Load your actual Afrobarometer dataset
# Replace 'path_to_your_actual_data.csv' with the actual file path
afrobarometer_data <- read_csv("path_to_your_actual_data.csv")

# Ensure the 'urban_rural' and 'corruption_perception' columns are factors
afrobarometer_data <- afrobarometer_data %>%
  mutate(
    urban_rural = factor(urban_rural, levels = c("Urban", "Rural")),
    corruption_perception = factor(corruption_perception)
  )

# Summarize the data to calculate proportions
corruption_summary <- afrobarometer_data %>%
  group_by(urban_rural, corruption_perception) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(urban_rural) %>%
  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count))

# Create the stacked bar chart
ggplot(corruption_summary, aes(x = urban_rural, y = proportion, fill = corruption_perception)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(
    title = "Corruption Perceptions by Residential Area",
    x = "Residential Area",
    y = "Proportion of Respondents",
    fill = "Corruption Perception"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
Explanation:

Data Loading and Preparation:
The dataset is loaded using read_csv(). Ensure you replace "path_to_your_actual_data.csv" with the actual path to your dataset.
The urban_rural and corruption_perception columns are converted to factors to ensure proper categorical handling. Adjust the levels of urban_rural if they differ in your dataset.
Data Summarization:
The data is grouped by urban_rural and corruption_perception to count occurrences.
Within each urban_rural group, proportions are calculated to represent the share of each corruption perception category.
Visualization:
A stacked bar chart is created using ggplot2, with urban_rural on the x-axis and the proportion of respondents on the y-axis.
The fill aesthetic differentiates the levels of corruption_perception.
The y-axis is formatted to display percentages for clarity.
The theme is set to minimal, and x-axis text is angled for better readability.
Additional Considerations:

Data Validation: Ensure that the urban_rural and corruption_perception columns in your dataset are correctly labeled and contain the expected categories.
Customization: You can customize the color palette by adding + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") or another palette of your choice.
Interpretation: This visualization will help you compare how corruption perceptions vary between urban and rural respondents, providing insights into potential differences in experiences or perceptions based on residential areas.

Here is a draft write-up for the visualization titled Age Group vs. Corruption Perception based on your data section rubric:

Visualization Title: Corruption Perceptions Across Age Groups

Description:
This faceted bar chart illustrates the relationship between respondents' age groups and their perceptions of corruption in Nigeria. The visualization is divided into four panels, each representing a specific corruption perception level: All Corrupt, High Corruption, Some Corruption, and No Corruption. Each bar within the panels represents the count of respondents within a specific age group (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, and 55+), highlighting differences in perceptions across age cohorts.

Key Observations:

High Corruption Perception:
Respondents in the 25–34 and 35–44 age groups demonstrate the highest counts in the High Corruption category.
Younger respondents (18–24) and older groups (55+) exhibit relatively lower counts, suggesting that middle-aged individuals perceive higher levels of corruption.
Some Corruption:
The Some Corruption category displays a similar trend, with the 25–34 and 35–44 age groups again dominating.
Notably, younger and older respondents are less likely to report this perception.
All Corrupt:
The counts for the All Corrupt perception are relatively even across the 25–34, 35–44, and 55+ groups, indicating a broader consensus across these age ranges.
The 18–24 and 45–54 groups show slightly reduced counts, potentially reflecting differing perceptions or experiences with corruption.
No Corruption:
The No Corruption category has consistently low counts across all age groups, suggesting a minimal belief in the absence of corruption regardless of age.
Interpretation:
This chart underscores significant variation in corruption perceptions by age group, particularly highlighting the strong association of middle-aged respondents (25–44 years old) with higher corruption perceptions. The relatively low representation of younger and older individuals in these categories might reflect differences in exposure to corruption or variations in expectations of governance. Conversely, the consistently low belief in No Corruption reveals a widespread acknowledgment of corruption as a persistent issue among all age groups.

Relevance to Analysis:
These findings align with broader literature on governance and corruption in Nigeria, which often implicates structural inequalities and socio-economic challenges disproportionately affecting middle-aged individuals. Understanding these patterns by age group can provide policymakers with targeted insights for addressing corruption-related concerns among specific demographics.

Let me know if you'd like to adjust the tone, include specific statistical interpretations, or refine the insights further!
